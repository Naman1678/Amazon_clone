## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

To clone the project to your local machine, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Naman1678/Amazon_clone.git


### 2. Install and configure XAMPP
XAMPP is an open-source platform used to run Apache server and MySQL on your local machine.

Download and Install XAMPP:
Go to the XAMPP download page.
Download the XAMPP installer suitable for your operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS).
Follow the installation instructions to install XAMPP.
Start the XAMPP server:
Open the XAMPP Control Panel (installed with XAMPP).
Click Start next to Apache and MySQL to start the server and database.
Apache handles the web server (HTTP requests).
MySQL manages the database.
Make sure both services are running (green indicators).

### 3. Set up the database
Once XAMPP is running, access phpMyAdmin through your web browser:

Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
Create a new database named amazon_clone.
